# Sentiment-Analysis
The IMDB large movie review dataset has many positive and negative reviews on movies and can be downloaded from here (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Using the provided training and testing data for our network. We go through data preprocessing to prepare the data for NLP. Then, create a network to classify the review as positive or negative


The following are provided:

• train_NLP.py and test_NLP.py files that train and test the network with the datasets provided and that run directly from the command line to train and test the network.

o Assuming the data resides in the data directory in a folder called aclImdb, exactly like that you downloaded (not uploaded!)

• Saved model as ‘Grouo_24_NLP_model’ in your models directory. Again, saved in .h5 format since it will be loading it yourself in our test file.
